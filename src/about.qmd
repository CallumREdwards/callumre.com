Hello ðŸ‘‹ I'm **Callum**.

I moved from Cambridge to Camden, London in 2021 after having graduated from Trinity Hall with a BA in Computer Science. I have since been working as a Software Engineer at G-Research, a leading quantitative research and technology firm.

My technical interests currently lie in Machine Learning, Distributed System Design, Data Engineering, Functional Programming Languages and Mathematics. I decided to create this blog to document and share any new projects/learnings in these areas.

Please reach out if you have any suggestions or comments!
