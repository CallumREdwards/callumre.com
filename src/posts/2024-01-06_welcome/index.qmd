Hi everyone, welcome to the first post on this blog.

It's the start of 2024 and I have decided to finally have a go at writing my own blog. I have been reading a lot of other technical blogs for a while now, and each time I think to myself that it would be great to do something like that myself. Well, I've finally had a go! 

# What am I hoping to get out of it?

I've had a think about why I actually want to write a blog, in the hopes that it acts as a reminder when I'm feeling less motivated.

### Document my learnings

> "Documentation is a love letter that you write to your future self." - Damian Conway

(Apologies to all those who find quotes cringy but this won't be the only one...)

Anyone who knows me well knows that I have a particularly bad long-term memory. Lots of people probably say that they have a bad memory, but I am on another level. I honestly struggle to remember anything past a year.

This is sad for many reasons but one such reason that I'm hoping that this blog will help with is forgetting interesting things I've read. I often read a book/paper/post and find something interesting, get into it for a bit, before eventually moving on and forgetting about it completely. I'm hoping by making the task of writing something to this blog small, the energy required to document these learnings is reduced. Then in the (hopefully not so imaginary) future, I'll be able to look back over a collection of thoughts that I've saved with some clarity and (maybe) pride.

### Better understanding

When reading or listening to something I often gloss over details that don't click with me instantly. Comparatively, I find that writing my learnings forces me to reach a fuller understanding of a topic as I am forced to write out all the stages of reasoning. I did this throughout school and university to a good deal of success, but haven't attempted doing this in situations of 'self-learning'. By sharing new fun intellectual discoveries in these posts, I will hopefully discover pitfalls in my knowledge from when I first *understood* them and end up seeing a more complete picture.

### Improving my writing

Writing is a skill that I have yet to master. I think I peaked at the end of university after several intense years of coursework and exams, where I had to write lots and often. But even then I wasn't particularly good and was very slow at it. Since moving to London and starting my job as a software engineer, this skill has definitely degraded. Predictably writing code does not exercise the same part of the brain as writing a page of full sentences. 

This blog will give me a reason to exercise the writing part of my brain once more, and so in time get better. The writing on this post might not be of the best quality but as long as the next one is, I'll be satisfied. 

*Edit: Even writing this first page was surprisingly difficult to get into any kind of flow state to begin with but it already started getting easier towards the end.* 

### Improving my typing

> "Someone is sitting in the shade today because someone planted a tree a long time ago." - Warren Buffet

For someone whose day job is spent mostly attached to a keyboard, I am impressively slow at typing. I don't type with two fingers but embarrassingly I'm not that far off.

I'm going to use this opportunity to also actively focus on teaching myself touch typing. In truth, this won't be my first time learning to touch type but I think with writing more often, I won't end up just forgetting about it.

My plan for a future post is to set up some kind of public tracker for this so I, and others, can monitor how my typing speed changes over time with practice... and hopefully share my success.

### Making it public

I care more about what I put on the internet publicly than some random notes in my [obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) vault. By writing up my learnings in full and then sharing them on this blog I will

1. Write **better** content that I will more easily understand in the distant future
2. Write **more frequently** as I've told people I will

> "Strive not to be a success, but rather to be of value." - Albert Einstein

Either because they have introduced me to some exciting new idea or helped me understand something I was struggling with, I have appreciated other people who have spent their time writing and then sharing blog posts.

By making my learnings public, I hope that someone who is learning about a post's topic in the future will have an easier time. Equally, I know not everyone will find the future topics of these blogs as exciting as I do but perhaps there will be a few that stumble upon this blog and will also get some excitement out of them.

### A portfolio

My current plan is to write at least one post each month. This goal isn't too high that I'll miss it early on, and it isn't too low that by next year I'll have been disappointed with the progress.

Let's say I keep this going for 10 years, then I'll have (12 * 10 =) 120 posts. A portfolio of technical / mathematical posts of this size will demonstrate my love for learning and so could open up future opportunities.

# Experiementing

This blog is an experiment. Hopefully, it will be a successful one but so far it has been fun making it even if it isn't. 

If you like any of the future posts please leave a comment or reach out to me. It will help keep me going!
